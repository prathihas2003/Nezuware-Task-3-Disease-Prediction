About Dataset :


This dataset has 132 parameters on which 42 different types of diseases can be predicted.

Goal: 
Develop a machine learning model in Python to predict the likelihood of a person having a particular disease based on their medical history and 
demographic information. Utilize classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines to analyze features like 
symptoms, medical test results, age, gender, and lifestyle factors. Train the model on labeled medical data and evaluate its performance using metrics 
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implement techniques for handling imbalanced data and missing values.

Content: 
Complete Dataset consists of 2 CSV files . One of them is training and other is for testing your model.

Each CSV file has 133 columns. 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and last column is the prognosis.

These symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases you can classify these set of symptoms to.

You are required to train your model on training data and test it on testing data
